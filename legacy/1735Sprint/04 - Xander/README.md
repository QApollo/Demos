# OCA Demo Chapter 5

## Chapter 5
Chapter 5 Class design
Chapter 5 went over inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces and polymorphism

## Demo
For chapter 5 I made a small demo where different characters inherit from a abstract CharacterBase class.
What type of attacks these characters have is dependent on what interface they implement.

There are 3 characters and 3 interfaces.

Crusader implements MeleeInterface and HolyInterface.
Necromancer implements MagicInterface and UnholyInterface.
DragonKnight implements MeleeInterface and MagicInterface.
