# OCA Demo Chapter 2

## Chapter 2
Chapter 2 went over operators and statements.
Things like if, switch, while, do-while, for and for each statements.
And a plethora of different operators

## Zakmon
I made a small game which is called Zakmon. The game is a small battle system like you would find in pokemon.
The name Zakmon is from translating the first part of pokemon to dutch, since pokemon stands for Pocket monster and pocket in dutch is zak.
When I started programming this it kind of grew past the point I expected it to and includes a lot more stuff then Chapter 2 covered.

The file ch2-parts.java contains snippets of the code that make use of CH2. 
However that file does not compile it is merely snippets of code in a .java file for syntax highlighting in your IDE of choice.

Feel free to critize everything in the demo if you have the time. 

To compile it simply compile GameManager.java and Zakmon.java
