# OCA Demo Chapter 3

## Chapter 3
Chapter 3 went over mutability and immutability, String manipulation,
arrays single dimensional and multidimensional and methods inherent to them.
Also time was discussed with it's functions(adding,removing,formatting)

## Zakmon
The game stayed the between chapter 2 and 3 however I changed a few things.
Instead of using an normal array for holding the choose able Zakmons they are now being stored in an ArrayList.
I also added a few more zakmon and depending on your time you get a different set of zakmon in the ArrayList.

originally I wanted to add the ability to use items by storing them in a 2D ArrayList.
I got that to work but the code was messy and decided to remove it.
